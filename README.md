___


### Misc principles/conventions

1. … - 3N - 4m - 4N is negative, offer to play  (over 4M, 4N = keycard)
1. 1X - 1Y - 2N* = (like 3X, but < 3 card support for Y. On over interference if a jump)
1. 1D - 2M* (reverse flannery) - 2N* (ask for strength and # hearts) (4min/5+min/4max/5+max)
1. 1H - (X/1S) - ?
     - 2S* = limit+ with forcing pass if they bid 4S or higher
     - 2N*  = limit+ with no forcing pass
1. Preempt keycard 4C (also **3C-4D**, and **4C-4D**. steps 0, 1, 1with, 2, 2with, 3, etc.)
1. 5N specific king doesn’t promise all keycards (answer 6N if you want to bid grand assuming we have all keycards)
1. Transfer lebensohl if they interfere after our 1N (transfers skip their suit, cuebid = stayman)
1. leaping and **non-leaping michaels** examples (GF) (any time they open >= 2 level or they bid and raise just one suit. applies to artificial openings/preempts as well. examples: (1H) - (3H) - 4m*)
1. bogust (1st/3rd equal or fav), otherwise feature
1. muppet stayman (same for balancing 2N and 2N overcalls)
1. Transfers after 1M - (X) and 2M - (X) starting at cheapest NT
1. preempt - (X) - XX = kranyak XX (asking preempter to X their suit bid with shortness, otherwise pass)
1. Fit showing jumps in competition, **fit non jumps by passed hand at the 3 level+**
1. After 4C gerber, 5C is king ask, 6C is to play
1. 2N over their 2D/2H/2S in comp is good/bad when game is in the picture. Otherwise it’s some kind of takeout / 2+ places to play
1. sandwich NT only by passed hand
1. 2way nmf and XYZ on always (in comp, after X, or by passed hand)
1. If they interfere our keycard ask:
	- DEPO if they interfere our keycard ask >= our suit
	- If they X our keycard ask, we ignore them
	- Otherwise, X = first step, pass = second step, etc.
1. In general, if they X when we would have responded in steps/conventionally, ignore their X and answer normally (no ROPI. answer bogust normally, etc.)
1. 3N = gambling (4C/5C/6C = pass/correct. 4N/5N = quantitative in length)
1. (1D precision) - 1N = raptor (4M, 5+m)
	- 2C as pass/correct for minor (if overcaller bids 2D, 2H is pass or correct for the major)
	 - 2D asks for 4 card major
	 - 2M is natural, to play
 1. The first cuebid shows A/K, subsequent cuebids show any control (A/K/shortness) (don't show shortness in partner's suit)
 1. Reverse drury (off over interference)
___

### Forcing pass is on in the following cases:
	- GF auctions (i.e. 1H - (2S) - 3C - (4S), forcing pass is on since 3C was GF)
	- When responder shows inv+ strength and they bid at the 5 level or higher
	- When we cuebid their suit showing a strong raise forcing to the 4 level or higher
	- After they preempt and delay raise to game over our game (preemptor self raising also counts)

Examples:
(3D) - (pass) - 3H - 4H - (5D) is forcing pass
(3D) - (pass) - 3H - (pass) - (4D) is NOT forcing pass (since 4D isn’t game)
(4D) - 4H - (5D) is NOT forcing pass (since the raise was immediate, not delayed)
(3D) - 3H - (pass) - (4D) is NOT forcing pass (because 3H and 4D aren’t games)
(4D) - 4H - (pass) - (5D) is forcing pass


___

### Doubles
	- Support doubles up to 4H (above 2H optional), except 1D - 1M - (1N nat) - X = values
	- lead-deflecting doubles at the 4 level or higher
	- doubles of artificial mixed raises are takeout in their suit
	- doubles of artificial limit raises are lead directing
	- pass of redouble is business at 3 level or higher, or if we're behind the suit
If no prior agreement, then:

	- double of an artificial bid is always penalty
	- double of a pass or-correct call is always penalty
	- in a game forcing auction, double is always penalty

If they have transfer responses/advances, X = natural of the suit doubled, bidding their suit = takeout, otherwise bid like they had bid naturally. example:
### (1C) - (1H showing spades) - ?
	- X = hearts
	- 1S = takeout of spades
	- 2S = natural



_______


### Leads/Carding
- Rusinow honor leads down to the 9 (i.e. 8 does not promise the 9 or shortness)
- Rusinow off (back to standard leads) in the following cases:
	- Leading partner’s suit (if partner bid the suit naturally at least once, not forced, or if it’s a suit partner has implied in the bidding, i.e. with a 2-suited bid. takeout X does not count as any suit). 1D opener does not count as diamonds.
	- Leading trump
	- If dummy has bid the suit naturally
	- If a preemptor is leading a side suit
	- When leading to a lead-directing X
- upside down remainder count
- low from odd, high from even when leading remainder count in cashout situations

**vs suits**
trump suit preference (LMH = no signal, Hxx = high, Mxx = middle, LHM = low)

**vs NT**
during the hand: attitude / original 4th best
K is strong (standard count or unblock)
reverse smith echo

___________


### 1C - ?
	- 1D = 0-7/8
	- 1M = natural
	- 1N = 5+ clubs (next 3 suits rotated to save space)
	- 2C = 5+ diamonds (next 3 suits rotated to save space)
	- 2D/2H/2S = balanced (8-10/11-13/14+), 2S forcing to 4N, 2S-3N = range ask (14-15, 16-17, etc)
		- 2N = stayman, steps: none, hearts, spades, both
		- 3M (if a jump) is short in the other major, looking for NT (i.e. usually 1345 or 1255)
		- 4C = gerber (0/4,1,2,3)
		- 4N = quantitative
	- 2N/3C/3D/3H = one-under (4441), bidding next step (the shortness) is a control ask (0-2, 3, 4, etc)



### 1C - 1D - 1M (4+ length, F1) - ?
	- 1S = 0-7 4+S
	- 1N = 0-5 any shape (except 4+ card support)
		- 2m = NF
		- 3m = F1
		- 2N = GF with longer minor
	- 2C = 6-7, < 3 card support
		- 2D = waiting non GF
		- others = GF natural
	- 2D = 5-7, 3 card support
	- 2M = 0-4, 4+ support
	- 3X, 4X = splinters
	- 2N = GF 4+M (like "jacoby")
	- 3M = 5-7 4+M

- 1C - 1D - 1S - 2H = 5-7, 5+ hearts, < 3 spades

### Normal kokish after 1C - 1D


### 1C - (X) - ?
	- 1D = positive with 5 diamonds
	- 2C = positive wiht 6 diamonds

### vs 1C interference

If they interfere up to 2N or less:

	- pass = 0-4
	- X = any 5-7
	- new suit = GF, natural
	- cuebid of their suit = balanced GF, no stopper
	- NT = balanced, GF, with stopper

At higher levels:

	- X = takeout/values
	- Over 4C+ interference, X = T/O GF, pass is *forcing* asking for a X

- After interference (not 1D or X), jumps are long suits, semi-positive (5-8)

Other examples:
### 1C - (1S) - pass / X - (2S) - ?
	- pass = minimum (usually balanced)
	- X = takeout (shortness in spades or strong)
	- 2N = 2 places to play (weaker than starting with a X)
	- 3 of a suit = NF (usually 6+ length, 16-19)
It’s similar to (1S) - pass - (2S) - ?

### 1C - (some interference) - anything - (anything) - ?
	- 2N (if a jump) = 22-24 (systems on)

____________


### 1D - ?
	- 1M = natural
		- 2N = 6+ diamonds, invitational (like 3D rebid), balanced
		- 3D = 6+ diamonds, invitational with 3-card M support
		- 3M = unbalanced, 4 card support, max
		- 4D = running 6+ diamonds (~AKQxxx+) + 4 card support
	- 2m = F1 when unpassed
	- 2M = reverse flannery 
		- 2N* (ask for strength and # hearts) (4min/5+min/4max/5+max)
	- 2N = natural, inv (natural bidding afterwards)
	- 3C = natural invitational
	- 3D = weak
	- 3S = transfer to 3N
	- 4N/5N = quant
	- all other jumps weak (same in competition)

### 1D - 2m - ?
	- 2H = art min balanced (1N rebid range)
	- 2S = unbalanced, 4+ spades
	- 2N = unbalanced, 4+ hearts
	- 3m = 4+ support, NF
	- 3M = splinter
	- 4M = exclusion

- 1D - 2m - 2H* - 3M = 6/5+ GF
- 1D - 2m - 2D/2H - 2N/3m = natural invitational
- 1D - 2m - 2D/2H - next step = artificial GF

### 1D - 2C - ?
	- 2D = 6+ diamonds, min
	- 3D = 6+ diamonds, max GF

### 1D - (X) - ?
	- XX = hearts
	- 1H = spades
	- 1S = transfer to NT
	- 1N = minors
	- 2m = F1 (if unpassed)
	- 3S = transfer to 3N
	- all other jumps weak

### 1D - (1H) - ?
	- X = spades
	- 1S = transfer to NT
	- 1N = minors (8+ cards in the minors)
	- 2m = F1 (if unpassed)
	- 2H = GF clubs
	- 3C = invitational
	- 3H = transfer to 3N
	- all other jumps weak


### 1D - (1S) - ?
	- 1N = nat
	- 2m = F1 (if unpassed)
	- 2S = GF clubs
	- 3C = minors
	- 3S = transfer to 3N
	- all other jumps weak

### 1D - (1N) - ?
	- X = values (penalty)
	- 2C = majors
	- 2X = natural (weak)


____

### 1M - ?
	- 2N = limit+, relay to 3C (then rebidding 3M is the limit raise, everything else GF)
		- Breaking relay is distributional, 5/5+ GF slammy
	- 3m = natural, inv
	- 3M = 0-9, preemptive-mixed (vul dependent)
	- 2 tiered splinters (3M+1 = weaker than direct)

- 1S - 3H and 1H - 2S = 3 card unbalanced limit raise (11-12)
- 1H - 2H - 2N = short suit spade try (replacement)
- 1H - 3N = strong spade splinter (replacement)

### 1M - (X) - ?
	- XX = values
	- transfers starting at 1N to 2M-1
	- 2M = weaker than 2M-1

### 1M - (1N) - ?
	- X = 11+ points
	- 2X = natural (weak)


____


### 1N - ?
	- 2N = transfer to diamonds (bid them with Jxx+)
	- 3H = GF 5/5 minors
	- 3S = 4441 (short clubs)
	- 4C = gerber (0/4, 1, 2, 3)
	- 4D/4H = texas (strong NT)
	- 4M = to play (mini NT)
	- 5m = to play

Systems on after 2C or X (artificial) interference. Otherwise X is takeout.

#### 1N - 2C - 2D - ?
	- 2H = both majors weak (pass / correct)
	- 2S = invitational with 5 spades

#### 1N - 2X - 2M - ?
	- 3oM = unbalanced slam invite (careful, i.e. 1N - 2H - 2S - 3H), next step asks
	- 4C = 1430 keycard
	- 4D = balanced slam invite
	- 4N = quantitative
	- 4M (after a transfer) = very light slam invite (i.e. 1N - 2D - 2H - 4H)

#### 1N - 2D - 2H - 2S* (relay) - 2N* - ?
	- 3m = inv 5m/5H
	- 3H/3S/3N = 55 majors (inv/gf/slammy)

**Other examples:**
1N - (2H) - 3D = inv+ with spades
1N - (2X) - 3N = denies stopper (to show a stopper, go through lebensohl)

After 1N - (2X), still play systems on above 3N (texas, gerber, etc.) (i.e. 1N - (2N) - 4C = gerber)

After 1N - (X), where X=strong/penalty, then do meckwell runouts (by both):
### 1N - (X) - ?
	- pass = NF
	- XX = one minor or both majors
	- 2m = that suit and a higher (could be both minors)
	- 2M = natural

When they double our stayman, jacoby or texas transfer, example:
### 1N - 2H - (X) - ?
	- 2S = 3+ spades
	- pass = 2 spades (then XX = retransfer)
	- XX = 4+ hearts (offer to play)
	- XX (of a texas transfer) = “I think this will play better from your side”

### 1N - 2C - (X) - ?

1N - 2C - (X) (answer directly with a club stopper, otherwise pass asking for XX so you can bid 1 under your response)
1N - 2C - (X) - pass - 2D/2M = garbage stayman (bid 4 card major if you have)
1N - 2C - (X) - pass - XX - 2H = 4 spades
1N - 2C - (X) - pass - XX - 2S = no 4 card major
1N - 2C - (X) - XX = 4+ clubs, usually no 4 card major, (offer to play)

In general, XX of any artificial bid at the 3 level or lower (where XX isn’t already defined) is an offer to play. XX of bids at the 4 level or higher show 1st round control




____

### 2C - ?
	- 2D*
		- 2H = 4 card M, next step ask: low/high min, low/high max, low/high running clubs
		- 2S = shortness, next step ask: low/middle/high
		- 2N = no shortness, stoppers in at least 2 of the other 3 suits
		- 3C = no shortness (usually weaker than 2N)
		- 3D/3H/3S = natural, 6/5+
	- 2M = nat, NF, constructive
	- 2N forces 3C, after which 3D/3H/3S = GF, 6+ length
	- 3D/3H/3S = invitational, 6+ length (faster = weaker)
	- 3C forces 3D, then 3H/3S/3N = GF 2suiters (HS/SD/DH) (tip: 3M = suit+higher, 3N = other 2 suiter)

systems **off** after 2C - (X)
systems **on** after 2C - 2D/2N/3C - (X)

___

### 2D - ?
	- 2N* = ask
		- 3C = any min (4405 is never a min)
			- 3D re-ask
				- 3M = 4315 with 4 in the M
				- 3N = 4414
		- 3D = 4414 extras
		- 3M = 4315 extras (with 4 in the M)
		- 3N = 4405
	- 3D = control ask (0-2,3,4,etc)
	- 2H/2S/3C = to play, but if 4315, pull 2H to 2S
	- 3H/3S/4C = inv
	- rest nat

___


### 2N - 3C (muppet) - 3N* (5 hearts) - ?
	- 4C = natural (implies 4 spades)
	- 4D = puppet to 4H (could keycard after or pass)
	- 4H = ***slam try agreeing hearts***, NF
	- 4S = cuebid for hearts
	- 4N = quant (go through 4D-4H if want to keycard)
	- 5m = natural

### 2N - 3C - 3H* (no 4/5 M) - ?
	- 3S = 5+ spades, 4+ hearts 
		- 3N 
			- 4H = 5+ spades, 5+ hearts.
		- 4H = slam try agreeing spades

- 2N - 3H* - 3S - 4H = good slam try in spades (stronger than 2N - 3H - 3S - 4S)
- 2N - 3C - 3H* - 3S - 4H = good slam try in spades


### 2N - 3C - 3D* - ?
	- 4C = both majors slammy
	- 4D = negative
	- 4M = stronger
	- 4D = bid your major

### 2N - 3C - (X) - ?
	- systems on over double, pass shows no club stopper, responder XX to re-stayman

### 2N - 3S* (forces to 3N to show minors) - 3N - ?
	- 4m = ***other minor*** (4C = D, 4D = C)
		- next step is waiting, willing to play in minor or NT (then next step by partner is keycard)
		- second step 1430 keycard
		- other suits are cue bids for minor
	4N = to play, no interest in minor
	4H = 5/4 better clubs
	4S = 5/4 better diamonds
	4N = 5/5 non forcing
	5C = 5/5 forcing

Systems on over (2X) - 2N
Systems on after 2N - (3C) and 2N - (X artificial), otherwise X = takeout.
 _____________________________________________________

### vs their 1NT
- aggressive-meckwell (can be light on points, any shortness) vs strong NT (***or when passed hand against weak NT***)
- pseudo-meckwell vs weakNT when unpassed hand (where X shows points, 2C shows spades + a round suit, rest like normal meckwell)
*(rationale is that when you’re a passed hand, you no longer need a X to show points so can play normal meckwell)*

**When they open 1N weak and we double, NT systems on in most cases:**
(1N) - X
(1N) - pass - (pass) - X
(1N) - pass - (pass) - X - (XX)
(1N) - X- (XX) (regardless of what XX means)
(1N) - pass - (2C) - X (systems still on, just have no stayman. use puppet stayman if strong enough and hopefully don’t have both majors..)


### vs their strong 1C:
	- X = majors, NT = minors, rest natural
	- direct bids = 0-12
	- pass and then bid/X later = 13+ (full opener)
